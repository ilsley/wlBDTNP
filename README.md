# BDTNP data in Mathematica 

These scripts convert data from the [Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project (BDTNP)](http://bdtnp.lbl.gov/Fly-Net/bioimaging.jsp?w=summary) to Mathematica format and have been made available for the purpose of scientific reproducibility (see https://github.com/ilsley/qTALE).

If you make use of the data, please cite the original source as appropriate, for example: Fowlkes et al. (2008). A Quantitative Spatiotemporal Atlas of Gene Expression in the Drosophila Blastoderm. _Cell_ 133, 364â€“374.

Steps:

1. Run the Python script. This creates files in the *intermediate* directory.
2. Run the Mathematica script (with Mathematica 10). This creates a Mathematica package file in the *final* directory. (It takes some time.)

The project has the following directory structure:

| Directory     | Content     |
|:------------- |:------------|
| original      | The original data downloaded from http://bdtnp.lbl.gov/Fly-Net/bioimaging.jsp?w=releases. |
| intermediate  | Files created by the Python script |
| final         | The BDTNP Mathematica package file generated by the Mathematica script |
| scripts       | The Python and Mathematica scripts |
